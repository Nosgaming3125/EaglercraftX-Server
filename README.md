# EaglerCraftX Server Setup
## I remade the main.sh so it installs everything to get the server running.
You only need to open the console using this command:
<br>
<br>
`Run: chmod +x main.sh`
<br>
<br>
`./main.sh`
<br>
<br>
`tmux attach-session -t server_session`
<br>
<br>
## Making Server Public
Great! Now, you need to forward ports  `8081` and `25565` and navigate to your servers public ip [server-ip:8081]. The server welcome page should be displayed. Congrats on running your own server!
